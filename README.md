# WeatherTracker

This weather app was built so that the user can simply type in the name of a city in the search bar and pull information from the Open Weather public API.  After clicking search, the current weather for the inputed city will show up, as well as a 5 day forecast.  The information showcased includes name of city, temp, humidiy, UVI and windspeed.   The user can check multiple different cities, and go back to any of them while searching to view the current tempratures etc. 

# Technologies Used 

This app was built off of a mix of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  The JS was used mainly to fetch from the APIs and ultimatley display the data in their respective cards or containers.  

The HTML and CSS were used to button up the designs.
